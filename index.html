        that the machine is not currently in use!

    <div class="question-response">
      All 4 users reported having no difficulty using the kiosk.
      <br /><br />
      However, one user mentioned that when they first came to the shop they
      found the number of choices to be overwhelming, despite finding the
      interface itself to be straightforward.

      Question 3: Do you prefer the kiosk to ordering in person? Why or why not?

    </div>
    <div class="question-response">
      Most users prefered ordering in person because it allows them to interact
      with people and is more efficient.
      <br /><br />
      Conversely, those who prefered the kiosk have this preference because it
      allows them to avoid interacting with others.

        Although she is comfortable using the kiosk, she greatly prefers
        ordering in so that she can interact with people. Chloe is a frequent
        visitor of Ten One Tea House, and when there are too many people waiting
        at the register she chooses to use the kiosk, albeit reluctantly.

        Tim works long hours at his office job and often leaves work exhausted.
        On his way home he saw a boba shop that his friend Chloe reccommended
        and decided to give it a shot.
        <br /><br />
        When Tim entered he was glad to see the kiosk because it allowed him to
        avoid talking to people. He found the process simple and easy to
        navigate. However he found that there were way too many choices and not
        nearly enough descriptions. Having so many options that were practically
        mysteries to him was frustrating.

        Trevor represents what a new visitor may look like. New visitors are not
        invested in the product and consequently less likely to return if their
        first impression isn't great.

        Tim had a long day at work and fell asleep on the job. Yesterday his
        friend Chloe recommend that he try boba tea at a shop called Ten One Tea
        House that she frequents. After hearing Chloe's description, Tim was
        determined to try the drink, so much so that he dreamt of it in his
        sleep!

        Tim's alarm jolts him awake and he realizes that it is finally time to

        When Tim arrives at the shop he groans upon finding out that the line is
        VERY long. After looking around a bit he notices that the shop has an
        open kiosk and decides to try that instead.

        Tim has never been to the shop before and is a bit apprehensive about
        using the kiosk. However after seeing how simple the start screen seems
        he feels some relief.

      <div class="storyboard-text">
        However, when he starts ordering he is bombarded by a million different
        teas and toppings to choose from. Tim has never had boba and feels
        extremely overwhelmed. He has no clue what most of the drinks even
        contain and doesn't see any descriptions to help.

    <!-- Slide 8 -->

      <div class="storyboard-text">
        After a couple minutes of feeling confused, Tim begrudgingly chooses the
        most popular item he can find and settles for the default configuration.

    <!-- Slide 9 -->

      <img class="storyboard-image" src="assets/storyboarding/Slide 9.png" />
      <div class="storyboard-text">
        The rest of the process flows smoothly. Tim grabs his drink from the
        counter once he receives a text and gives his drink a try. He falls in
        love with the tea, celebrates and vows to be a frequent customer.
        Congrats Tim!!!
